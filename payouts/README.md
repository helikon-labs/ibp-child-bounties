This repo serves to document hours spent. 

Going forward members will no longer be reminded to provide hours, it's everyones own duty to document it in a timely matter.
Administratve hours have to be documented latest after one month. Hours approved for projects have no time restriction.

Latest the **20th** of every month you should create the PR and give memebrs 3 days time to review it if necessary. If no objections, merge the PR. 
Coinstudio will need the proper documented and **merged** hours latest by the 23th.

Documents older than 3 months should be moved to the archives directory.

## Guide
1) create a new branch
```shell
git checkout -b yyyymm-member
```
2) copy the `YYYYMM_MEMBER.md` file with the correct date and member name
```shell
cp ./YYYYMM_MEMBER.md ./202407_AMFORC.md
```

3) Document your hours spent and links to corresponding commits if avaiable
4) Do PR for the new branch
5) Members need to inform in the members chat.
6) Curators only need to inform other curators.
7) If there are no objections after 3 days merge the PR
