# Amforc
This are the hours for the coordination and setup of the github-runner for the fellowship, which now can be offered ecosystem wide. It started roughly in June 2024 and went on until January 2025 with various breaks and delays
| Date | Hours | Hour type | Link | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.2024 | 13 | Engineering | <link\> | Setup of normal self-hosted github runner. There were various things that had to be troubleshooted, some related to the fellowships defined actions, and some due to the setup of the runner. |
| 12.2024 | 13 | Engineering | [repo](https://github.com/ibp-network/ansible-role-github-runner-ephemeral) | For security reasons it was decided it makes sense to move to a ephemeral setup. Setup and testing of those |
| 1.2025 | 10 | Engineering | <link\> | Write and test ansible role  |

## Total Hours:
The hours spent were significantly more than this (for, Engineering and Administrative work), but it was going on for too long and at one point I lost track of hours. But this is fine for us.
- Engineering: 36
